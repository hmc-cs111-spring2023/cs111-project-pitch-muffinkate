# Project proposal

## The user and a language

This language is to digitally create quilting pantograph patterns that can be printed out and used on a long-arm quilting machine.

### What's the need?

_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help
them?_

This language is meant to help amateur home-quilters create and quilt more elaborate quilting patterns. Long-arm quilters currently have limited options for creating paper pantographs - if they want a digital pattern to print out, they can either buy a pattern for $15-25 online or buy quilting software to help automate this task. If they wish to create their own, the easiest way is to hand-replicate a pattern, or create one in an aformentioned quilting software and print it out.

Ideally, this experience could be made easier by having a dedicated platform to make pantographs that can create and modify the line design, as well as visualize how it gets repeated across a quilt surface, and being able to print it out according to quilt size specifications.

### Why a language?

_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_

I believe a DSL is appropriate for the need because it could leverage the automation of patterns, and quickly propogate an idea to visualize the larger pattern. Drawing one shape is probably easier by hand, but to have it be a pattern and then be the right size to print and then quilt is a more complicated procedure, that could benefit from all of those things being in the same place. In other words, since design aesthetics are a crucial component of this step in the quilting process, streamlining things like whether a design is a valid continuous line, with entrance and exit points at the same place, and being able to see how it would visually look across a quilt can help improve the creating and prototyping process of a pantograph design. 

As far as quilters using a programming language, computer aided design tools are often not compeletely unfamiliar to quilters

### Why you?

_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_

I like this idea because I'm a quilter myself, and it's been interesting to learn more about this technique and the technology available for it. Long-arm quilting is not something I personally do because I don't own a machine, but the quilting designs themselves are as important as the piecework of creating the quilt-top so I came up with it as I was exploring the patterns different textile artists create. I think it's exciting to potentially create a tool that will aid quilters in a part of the creation process that often gets outsourced, and offer them another degree of creative freedom.

### Domain

_Describe the project's domain in five words._

### Interface (syntax)

_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain?_

### Operation (semantics)

_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of errors might occur, and how might they be communicated to
the user?_

### Expressiveness

_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_

### Related work

_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_

## The Project

This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.

### Suitability

_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot
of language design)?_

### Scope

_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_

### Benefits and drawbacks

_Why might this be a good idea for a project? Why might this not be a good idea
project?_
