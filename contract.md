## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

I think it would be most satisfactory for me to have something that works. I like the feeling of building something, and this will be an interesting project to work on and motivate me to finish. Having something that I can personally point to and say "hey look I did this" is something not just for other people, but also for myself. I was unsure of myself when I first walked into this class, so to walk out with a working DSL would be a nice capstone to my HMC CS experience.

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

I think this project will teach me several new skills that I'm excited about. First, more about working with visualization and image generation in whatever host language I choose. It's always fun to be able to immediately see the impacts of what you're working on, and being able to have that in my toolkit is exciting. Additionally, I think designing for a potential user that doesn't have much coding experience is going to be a good challenge. I'm interested, career path wise, in increasing access to computational thinking so it's fun to think about this project in context of using creativity to reach a wider audience of people that could potentially leverage computers and coding. One challenge I'm already thinking about in terms of this is error handling, especially parser errors. Learning how to debug is a big part learning how to code, and so I'd like to work on the tricky details that go into error handling and how it gets communicated to the user.

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_
