## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

I think it would be most satisfactory for me to have something that works. I like the feeling of building something, and this will be an interesting project to work on and motivate me to finish. Having something that I can personally point to and say "hey look I did this" is something not just for other people, but also for myself. I was unsure of myself when I first walked into this class, so to walk out with a working DSL would be a nice capstone to my HMC CS experience.

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

I think this project will teach me several new skills that I'm excited about. First, more about working with visualization and image generation in whatever host language I choose. It's always fun to be able to immediately see the impacts of what you're working on, and being able to have that in my toolkit is exciting. Additionally, I think designing for a potential user that doesn't have much coding experience is going to be a good challenge. I'm interested, career path wise, in increasing access to computational thinking so it's fun to think about this project in context of using creativity to reach a wider audience of people that could potentially leverage computers and coding. One challenge I'm already thinking about in terms of this is error handling, especially parser errors. Learning how to debug is a big part learning how to code, and so I'd like to work on the tricky details that go into error handling and how it gets communicated to the user.

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

I plan to set aside time much in the same way I do clinic - where depending on the goals I have for the week, I schedule dedicated work time to make sure that it gets prioritized. I also have some milestones that I think will be helpful in creating these weekly goals. I am choosing not to plan them out in advance, because having strict deadlines sometimes stresses me out more when thinking about initial plans. However, I know that those intermediate milestones are going to look like first, the initial design and plan - what the design will be, what a sample program looks like, and the intended host language. After that, the implementation of the visualization of the design is going to be the biggest priority, and where I see most of the implementation and design changes happening. After that, the goal would be to implement the menu design, and shifting what operations I can - and intend to - away from a textual implementation.

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

Largely, by prioritizing it. Purposefully setting aside time to give feedback and thinking about what might be helful, based on what I would want or need out of a critique, and making sure to put effort into giving it to my classmates.

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

I think I'd be most proud if I had something that worked. The biggest priority for me would be the ablity to create and propogate of a continuous line design for a quilting pantograph, but I'd be extra proud if it had all the functionality to make a printable pattern.

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

Because I think the implementation itself won't be a large battle in terms of what the host language will allow me to do, I think having a language that can create and propogate a continuous line design is an A-. Not only turning in all the things, but having a bare-bones working language. An A would be that it has that extra functionality, that I was able to implement more "finishing touches" of the design, as it were.
